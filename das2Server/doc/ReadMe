Directions for making changes to the GNomEx version of the DAS/2 Server (04/21/2016)

The src directory contains all the source (decompiled) from das2server.jar and genometry.jar

The binary directory contains a tar file of the current running DAS2DB webapp.

If you need to change something:

1) Edit the source

2) Compile using the .jar files in lib

3) Update the .class files in the existing das2server.jar (or genometry.jar)

4) Replace the jar files in DAS2DB.tar with your new ones
